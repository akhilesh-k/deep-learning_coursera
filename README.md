# deep-learning_coursera
Solutions to course 1 and 2 of Deep learning specialization by Dr. Andrew Ng on deep learning by DeepLearning.ai includes screenshots, code(jupyter notebooks). Please refer to the code for getting some help to save some time(if stuck on a very trivial problem), else please don't copy the codes and blindly jot down the solutions from the screenshots. 


DISCLAIMER:-  Some quiz solutions might be wrong as the screenshots were taken in an unplanned way, so please watch out for them. :)
